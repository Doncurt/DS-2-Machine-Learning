    "In this tutorial, we'll build our very **_K-Nearest Neighbors_** classifier (KNN for short).  This tutorial will be different from other tutorials in this class in that, unlike most other tutorials where we focus only on using the classifier provided in the `sklearn` library, KNN is simple enough that we can also build one from scratch in this tutorial! We'll still use `sklearn` for things such as such as splitting our data into training and testing sets, and for _scaling_ our data (more on this later), but we'll build the actual algorithm ourselves to get a feel for how it all works!"

    "\n",
    "The KNN algorithm is a classic choice for classification in Machine Learning.  KNN works on the assumption that things that are \"near\" each other are more similar, and therefore more likely to be the same class.  Here's a brief explanation of how KNN actually works under the hood:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  KNN stores all the data points and labels when `.fit()` is called.  No actual computation is done at this point. \n",
    "<br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2.  When used for predicting the class of an array of objects, the user passes in an array of X_values and a value for K.   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3.  KNN calculates the Euclidean distance between the point in question and all other points it stored during the `.fit()` step.   \n",
    "<br> \n",
    "4.  KNN uses these Euclidean distance metrics to select the K nearest points, and looks at what class each is.  \n",
    "<br> \n",
    "5.  The algorithm predicts that the data point in question is whichever class most the majority of it's K nearest neighbors are.  For instance, if `K=5`, and 3 of the neighbors for `X[0]` are class A and 2 are class B, the algorithm will predict that `X[0]` is class A.   "

    "    \n",
    "One quirk of Machine Learning algorithms is that they often do poorly if the scales of the data differ from column to column.  This is especially true for KNN, since the main measure of similarity we're using is Euclidean distance.  For example, let's think about the titanic dataset.  In the age column, a distance of 30 units is a very big deal--this is essentially the distance between children (high survival rate) and adults (medium survival rate), as well as between adults and the elderly (low survival rate).  What about a distance of 30 units in another column, such as ticket price?  With tickets ranging from free to $500+, a difference of 30 units in this column has much less importance.  Herein lies the problem--if we don't scale each column, then the difference in age--which is very important--will likely be drowned out by a column with a much larger scale, such as ticket price.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution? **_Scale_** our data to a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.  Since you've already done this sort of data transformation in DS1, we won't spend much time on it here.  Instead, we'll just use the `StandardScaler` object from SKLearn.\n",

    "1.  Create a `StandardScaler` object and store it in a variable.  \n",
    "2.  Pass in the data to be scaled using the `StandardScaler` object's `.fit()` method.  \n",
    "3.  Call the scaler's `.transform()` method on the data to be scaled (this should be the same data you passed in during the fit step) and store the result it returns in a variable.  You now data that is scaled for use in an algorithm such as KNN!"
