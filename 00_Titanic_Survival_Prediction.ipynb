    "**Welcome to _DS2: Introduction to Machine Learning_**!  This course will be all about _predictive analytics_--that is, using data and algorithms to make accurate predictions.  For our introductory exercise for this course, we're going to focus on the one of the areas where machine learning really shines--**_Classification_**.  We're going to examine the data and build a simple model to predict whether or not a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.  Here's the catch: before we use any machine learning, we're going to build a classifier by hand to gain an intuition about how classification actually works.  \n",

    "\n",
    "We're going to start by building the simplest model possible, and then slowly add complexity as we notice patterns that can make our classifier more accurate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we've investigated this dataset before, in DS1. We're going to use our _Data Analysis_ and _Visualization_ skills from DS1 to investigate our dataset and see if we can find some patterns that we can use in our prediction algorithm. In order to successfully build a prediction algorithm, we'll use the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.  Load and explore the data.**  \n",
    "    --We'll begin by reading our data into a dataframe, and then visualizing our data to see if we can find certain groups that had higher survival rates than others.  At this step, we'll also remove the `Survived` column from the dataframe and store it in a separate variable.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "**2.Write a prediction function.** \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    -- We'll write a function that takes in a dataframe and predicts 0 (died) or 1(survived) for each passenger based on whatever we decide is important.  This function should output a vector containing only 0's and 1's, where the first element is the prediction for the first passenger in the dataframe, the 2nd element is the prediction for the second passenger, etc.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "**3.  Write an evaluation function.**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    -- In order to evaluate how accurate our prediction function is, we'll need to track how it does.  To do this, we'll create a _confusion matrix_.  This matrix will exist as a dictionary that tracks the number of _True Positives_, _True Negatives_, _False Positives_, and _False Negatives_ our algorithm makes--don't worry if you haven't seen these terms before. We'll define them in a later section.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. Tweak our prediction function until we're happy!**\n",
    "    --once we've built out the functions that underpin our predictive algorithm, we'll tweak them until we hit our desired accuracy metric.  In this case, **_we'll shoot for an accuracy of at least 80%._**\n",
